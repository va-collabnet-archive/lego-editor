#
# Items should be tab or comma seperated (but consistent with the file name - csv for comma, tsv for tab)
# 'Qualifier Concept Code' and 'Value Concept Code or Text' are optional
# If 'Value Concept Code' is a numeric value, it will be treated as a concept, if not, treated as plain text.
# Items may be surrounded by double quotes, or may simply be csv or tsv seperated.
# In a CSV file to escape a comma, or in a TSV file to escape a tab - prefex it with \
# Prefexing is not necessary if the fields around surrounded by "double quotes" however.
# To escape a double quote, prefix it with \.  See the last line for examples.
