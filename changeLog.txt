Lego Editor Change Log
2013/03/?? - 0.58
  *  Filtered '(' and ')' out of the lucene queries so they FSNs don't cause searches to fail.
  *  Fixed a bug where the PNCS filter drop down wasn't being updated after a new lego was created
  *  Fixed a bug where rapid changes to the lego list filters could cause strange behavior
  *  Fixed a null pointer that could happen in certain situations within the filter update.
  *  Fixed a null pointer that happened if you tried to view a new (unsaved) lego in the web browser
  *  Moved the validator calls into a background (non-GUI) thread
  *  Fixed a bug in the PointNode validation error reporting for intervals and bounds that was a 
     a regression in the 0.57 release. 
  *  artf227644 - Add CIMI import / viewer tool.

2013/03/14 - 0.57
  *  Fixed the summary view on/off switch so it takes effect on Legos that are already open.
  *  Fixed the behavior of the left arrow key in the concept combo-box editors
  *  Changed the behavior of the concept combo-box editors so that you don't lose the entire entry if 
  		the lookup fails. 
  *  Fixed a null pointer that could happen during certain copy operations
  *  Fixed a null pointer in the interval validator that could happen after a particular sequence
  		of add and remove operations.
  *  Fixed the LegoList tree so that you don't lose the scroll position everytime the filter is reapplied
  		(after adding a new Lego, or saving changes to a lego, for example)
  *  Fixed the auto-sizing of the error display dialog.
  *  Fixed a bug that would cause the editor to not display relations and relation groups properly after 
  		an expression was removed from a conjunction which only contained 2 expressions.
  *  Various spacing and alignment fixes for various nodes in the editor area.
  *  Add the ability to view Lego Lists and Legos in the system web browser.
  *  artf227502 Reworked parts of the lego editor so some fields take up less vertical space.
  		AssertionComponents now put the type editor on the same line as the label.
  		Expressions that are simple (only one concept) are now displayed on a single line.
  		The Relation Type field is now displayed on the first Relation line, rather than on a line by itself.
  		The Measurement editor now displays on a single line for the Point case, and the Units field
  		was moved up to the first line for the interval and bounds cases.  Also, the Interval and Bound
  		editor is no longer a distinct tree node, they are part of the Measurement tree node, so less
  		nodes to expand.
  *  artf227526 Add support for more advanced filtering - namely rel type and target filters, including
  		child of concept X filters for rel destination.

2013/03/11 - 0.56
  *  <DB COMPATIBILITY BREAKAGE> Updated to the latest (and final?) version of the schema.  
		This change makes it impossible to read the Lego database created with older editors.  Must 
		export the Legos using the previously installed version, and re-import.
  *  Added missing "Drop as Units" option to Timing and Measurement for drag and drop operations. 
  *  Fixed a null pointer that could happen on drag and drop from the SCT Tree View.
  *  Tweaked the sort order of the lego to move the comment to the top.
  *  Cleaned up the the consistency of interval notation vs set notation for displays of 
  		bounds and intervals.
  *  artf227370 <DB COMPATIBILITY BREAKAGE> Updated the snomed database that is used by the editor.
  		You will need the new snomed DB - 
  		https://csfe.aceworkspace.net/sf/frs/do/downloadFile/projects.veterans_administration_project/frs.lego_editor.snomed_database_0_56_and_newer/frs4344?dl=1
  *  artf227498 Change snomed concept drop down boxes to not show the SCTID, also reworked the 
  		concept filter option to not show the ID.
  *  artf227501 Add an option to expand all nodes recursively on each node in both trees.

  		DB was initialized.

  		concepts finished intializing.
